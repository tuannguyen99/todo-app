**Status**: ✅ Complete
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour
**Actual Time**: < 5 minutes (already implemented)

## Requirements
As a user, I want to delete todos I no longer need.

## Acceptance Criteria
✅ 1. Delete button on each todo item
✅ 2. Clicking delete removes todo immediately
✅ 3. Confirmation dialog (optional - skip if time constrained) - Skipped as requested
✅ 4. Todo removed from localStorage
✅ 5. UI updates immediately

## Technical Notes
- Add delete button to TodoItem component
- Call removeTodo function from useTodos hook
- Update localStorage
- No undo needed (keep it simple)

## Files Modified
- components/TodoItem.tsx - Delete button with red styling
- lib/hooks/useTodos.ts - `deleteTodo` function implemented
- components/TodoList.tsx - `onDeleteTodo` prop wired up
- components/TodoApp.tsx - Delete handler connected

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Summary
Delete functionality was **already fully implemented** in the codebase:
- `TodoItem` component has Delete button with proper styling and accessibility
- `useTodos` hook has `deleteTodo` function with localStorage sync
- `TodoList` and `TodoApp` components properly wire up the delete handler
- All tests pass (117/117)

### Testing Results
✅ All 117 tests pass
✅ Delete functionality verified in:
  - useTodos.test.ts (deleteTodo function)
  - TodoItem.test.tsx (Delete button interaction)
  - TodoApp.test.tsx (Integration test)

### Completion Notes
No code changes were necessary. The delete functionality was already implemented in previous stories with:
- Immediate UI update on delete
- localStorage synchronization
- Error handling with rollback on failure
- Accessible delete button with aria-labels
- Proper visual styling (red text with hover effect)
