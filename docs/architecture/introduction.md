# Introduction

This document outlines the complete architecture for the Todo List App, a client-side Next.js 14 application with browser-based local storage persistence. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the technology stack.

This architecture prioritizes **simplicity and clarity** as a learning project demonstrating BMAD methodology, while maintaining production-quality patterns for type safety, testing, and maintainability. The design focuses on client-side state management with React hooks, eliminating backend complexity while still following modern fullstack architectural principles.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a new project built from scratch using `create-next-app` with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. No starter templates or existing codebases are being used, allowing us to maintain full control over architectural decisions and demonstrate clean, purposeful design patterns.
