# Todo List App Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable users to quickly capture and organize daily tasks in a simple, intuitive interface
- Provide complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for todo items
- Ensure task data persists across browser sessions using local storage
- Deliver a responsive, mobile-friendly experience that works seamlessly on all devices
- Create a fast, distraction-free productivity tool with immediate user feedback

### Background Context

Many individuals struggle with task management due to overly complex productivity tools that require significant learning curves and ongoing maintenance. The market has a gap for minimalist, focused task management solutions that prioritize speed and simplicity over feature bloat.

This Todo List application addresses that need by providing a clean, modern interface for basic task management. Built as a learning project to understand BMAD methodology, it demonstrates full-stack development principles while solving a real user need. The app focuses exclusively on core task management functionalityadding, editing, completing, and deleting todoswith client-side persistence, making it accessible without requiring authentication or server infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Functional

**FR1:** Users can add a new todo item by entering text into an input field and submitting (via button click or Enter key)

**FR2:** The application displays all todo items in a list view showing the todo text and completion status

**FR3:** Users can edit an existing todo item's text by clicking an edit action, modifying the text, and saving the changes

**FR4:** Users can delete a todo item by clicking a delete action, with the item immediately removed from the list

**FR5:** Users can toggle a todo item's completion status by clicking a checkbox or completion indicator, with visual feedback showing completed vs. incomplete states

**FR6:** All todo items are automatically persisted to browser local storage, ensuring data survives page refreshes and browser sessions

**FR7:** On application load, all previously saved todos are retrieved from local storage and displayed to the user

**FR8:** The application provides clear visual feedback for all user actions (add, edit, delete, complete) with smooth transitions and animations

### Non Functional

**NFR1:** The application must be fully responsive, providing optimal user experience on mobile devices (320px width minimum) through desktop displays (1920px+ width)

**NFR2:** The application must load and become interactive within 2 seconds on standard broadband connections

**NFR3:** All user interactions (add, edit, delete, toggle complete) must provide visual feedback within 100ms to ensure perceived responsiveness

**NFR4:** The user interface must follow modern design principles with clean typography, appropriate spacing, and intuitive iconography

**NFR5:** The application must handle browser local storage quota limits gracefully, providing user notification if storage limits are approached

**NFR6:** The codebase must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled to ensure type safety and maintainability

**NFR7:** The application must be accessible via keyboard navigation, supporting tab navigation and Enter/Space key actions for all interactive elements

**NFR8:** The application should work across modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) with consistent behavior and appearance

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Create a minimalist, distraction-free interface that prioritizes clarity and speed. The design should feel modern and clean, with generous whitespace and clear visual hierarchy. Users should be able to understand the entire interface at a glance and perform any action within 1-2 clicks/taps. The experience should feel effortlessâ€”like writing on a notepad, but better.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Inline Editing:** Click/tap directly on todo text to edit in place (no modal dialogs)
- **Immediate Feedback:** All actions (add, complete, delete) provide instant visual response with subtle animations
- **Gestural Affordances:** Visual cues (hover states, icons) clearly indicate interactive elements
- **Keyboard-First Support:** Power users can navigate and manage todos entirely via keyboard
- **Optimistic UI Updates:** Changes appear immediately, assuming success (with rollback on error)

### Core Screens and Views

1. **Main Todo List View** - Single-screen application displaying all todos with add input at top
2. **Empty State View** - Welcoming prompt when no todos exist, encouraging first todo creation
3. **Error/Notification Toast** - Non-intrusive notifications for storage errors or important messages

### Accessibility

**WCAG AA** - Basic accessibility compliance including keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and semantic HTML. Focus indicators visible for keyboard users. Screen reader support for core actions.

### Branding

Modern, neutral design aesthetic with a professional but friendly tone. Use a contemporary color palette with a primary accent color for interactive elements and completion states. Typography should be clean and highly readable (likely sans-serif for UI, possibly serif for todo text for readability).

### Target Device and Platforms

**Web Responsive** - Desktop-first design that gracefully scales down to mobile. Optimized touch targets (44x44px minimum) for mobile use. Works across all modern browsers on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single repository containing the entire Next.js application. All code (components, utilities, types, tests) resides in one cohesive structure for simplified development and deployment.

### Service Architecture

**Monolith (Client-Side Only)** - Next.js application with App Router serving a client-side React application. No backend services or API routes required. All business logic executes in the browser with local storage for persistence.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Testing with Jest + React Testing Library** - Focus on unit tests for core business logic (todo CRUD operations, local storage utilities) and component tests for UI interactions. Aim for 70%+ code coverage on critical paths.

**Testing Strategy:**

- Unit tests for todo management logic and local storage utilities
- Component tests for user interactions (add, edit, delete, complete)
- Manual testing for cross-browser compatibility and responsive design
- No E2E tests initially (can be added post-MVP if needed)

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Next.js 14+ with App Router:** Use the modern App Router paradigm (not Pages Router) for better performance and developer experience
- **TypeScript Strict Mode:** Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json for maximum type safety
- **Tailwind CSS with Default Configuration:** Use Tailwind's default design system, customizing only as needed for brand colors
- **ESLint + Prettier:** Standard Next.js ESLint config with Prettier for consistent code formatting
- **Local Storage Wrapper:** Create a type-safe utility module for local storage operations with error handling
- **Todo Data Model:** Simple TypeScript interface: `{ id: string, text: string, completed: boolean, createdAt: number }`
- **UUID Generation:** Use `crypto.randomUUID()` for todo IDs (native browser API, no external dependencies)
- **No External State Management:** React's `useState` and `useEffect` sufficient for this scope (no Redux, Zustand, etc.)
- **Deployment Target:** Vercel or any static hosting platform (app is purely client-side, no server functions needed)
- **Node Version:** Node 18+ for development (aligns with Next.js 14 requirements)

## Epic List

### Final Decision

**âœ… READY FOR ARCHITECT** - The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. Quality Score: A- (92/100).

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

Review the **User Interface Design Goals** section of this PRD and create detailed UI/UX designs for the Todo List application. Focus on:

- Wireframes or mockups for the Main Todo List View and Empty State
- Component-level design specifications (TodoInput, TodoItem, Toast notification)
- Responsive breakpoint designs (mobile 320px, tablet 768px, desktop 1024px+)
- Interaction states (hover, focus, active, disabled, completed)
- Color palette and typography specifications aligned with the modern, minimalist aesthetic
- Accessibility annotations (ARIA labels, focus management, keyboard shortcuts)

Deliverable: UI/UX design document or prototype that the Architect and Developer can reference during implementation.

### Architect Prompt

Review this complete PRD, particularly the **Requirements**, **Technical Assumptions**, and **Epic/Story** sections. Create a comprehensive technical architecture document that defines:

- System architecture and component structure for the Next.js application
- Data flow and state management patterns (React hooks strategy)
- Component hierarchy and responsibilities (TodoApp â†’ TodoList â†’ TodoItem)
- Local storage integration architecture with error handling
- Testing strategy and mock patterns for localStorage
- File/folder structure following Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Type definitions and interfaces (extend from PRD's Todo model)
- Build and deployment configuration for Vercel

Focus on creating a client-side only architecture that supports the 13 user stories across 2 epics. Ensure the architecture enables individual stories to be developed independently by AI agents in 2-4 hour focused sessions.

Deliverable: Technical Architecture Document (architecture.md) ready for development team consumption.
