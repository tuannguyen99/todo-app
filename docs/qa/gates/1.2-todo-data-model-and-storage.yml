# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Input validation present, no data exposure risks, proper error handling prevents information leakage'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Efficient O(1) storage operations, JSON serialization optimal for expected data volumes, no blocking operations'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation, quota detection, empty array fallbacks ensure app stability'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean code structure, comprehensive JSDoc comments, 97.87% test coverage, follows all coding standards'

# Detailed findings
findings:
  strengths:
    - 'Exceptional test coverage (97.87% statements, 88.88% branches, 100% functions)'
    - 'Comprehensive error handling with StorageError class and user-friendly messages'
    - 'Type-safe implementation with TypeScript strict mode'
    - 'Proper validation with TODO_CONSTRAINTS for maintainability'
    - 'Clean separation of concerns (types, utils, services)'
    - 'All edge cases covered in tests (empty, whitespace, quota, invalid JSON)'
    - 'Graceful degradation when localStorage unavailable'

  improvements_applied:
    - action: 'Enhanced loadTodos error handling for graceful degradation'
      file: 'lib/services/todoStorage.ts'
      rationale: 'Read operations should never crash the app - return empty array instead of throwing when storage unavailable'
    - action: 'Updated test expectations to match new graceful degradation behavior'
      file: '__tests__/lib/services/todoStorage.test.ts'
      rationale: 'Tests should validate the improved resilient behavior'

  future_enhancements:
    - action: 'Consider property-based testing for validation edge cases'
      priority: 'low'
      story: 'Future refactoring story'
    - action: 'Add performance benchmarks for large todo arrays'
      priority: 'low'
      story: 'Epic 2 performance optimization'
